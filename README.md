    WAP to find the roots of a quadratic equation
  </li>
  <li>
    WAP to accept a number ‘n’ and
    <ol type="a">
      <li>Check if ’n’ is prime</li>
      <li>Generate all prime numbers till ‘n’</li>
      <li>Generate first ‘n’ prime numbers</li>
    </ol>
    This program may be done using functions

  <li>WAP that accepts a character and performs the following:
    <ol>
      <li>print whether the character is a letter or numeric digit or a special character</li>
      <li>if the character is a letter, print whether the letter is uppercase or lowercase</li>
      <li>if the character is a numeric digit, prints its name in text (e.g., if input is 9, outputis NINE)</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>
    WAP to perform the following operations on a string
    <ol>
      <li>Find the frequency of a character in a string.</li>
      <li>Replace a character by another character in a string.</li>
      <li>Remove the first occurrence of a character from a string.</li>
      <li>Remove all occurrences of a character from a string.</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>WAP to swap the first n characters of two strings.</li>
  <li>Write a function that accepts two strings and returns the indices of all the occurrences of the second string in the first string as a list. If the second string is not present in the first string then it should return -1.</li>
  <li>WAP to create a list of the cubes of only the even integers appearing in the input list (may have elements of other types also) using the following:
  <ol>
    <li>'for' loop</li>
    <li>list comprehension</li>
  </ol>
  </li>
  <li>WAP to read a file and
  <ol>
    <li>Print the total number of characters, words and lines in the file.</li>
    <li>Calculate the frequency of each character in the file. Use a variable of dictionary type to maintain the count.</li>
    <li>Print the words in reverse order.</li>
    <li>Copy even lines of the file to a file named ‘File1’ and odd lines to another file named ‘File2’.</li>
  </ol>
  </li>
  <li>Write a function that prints a dictionary where the keys are numbers between 1 and 5 and the values are cubes of the keys.</li>
  <li>Consider a tuple t1=(1, 2, 5, 7, 9, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10). WAP to perform following operations:
  <ol>
    <li>Print half the values of the tuple in one line and the other half in the next line.</li>
    <li>Print another tuple whose values are even numbers in the given tuple.</li>
    <li>Concatenate a tuple t2=(11,13,15) with t1.</li>
    <li>Return maximum and minimum value from this tuple</li>
  </ol>
  </li>
  <li>WAP to accept a name from a user. Raise and handle appropriate exception(s) if the text entered by the user contains digits and/or special characters.</li>
</ol>
